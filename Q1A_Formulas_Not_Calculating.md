##Question 1

##Support Case: Formulas Not Calculating

##Excel Version: Microsoft Excel (latest version)

There is a information about how to solve the problem if formulas are not calculating in excel spreadsheet.

I find two sites to make the problem clear.

[First Site](https://www.ablebits.com/office-addins-blog/excel-formulas-not-working/)

In this Website, I noticed various steps to fix the problem including Show Formulas mode is turned on, A formula is entered as text and A formula cell has a leading space.

I think that this site is very beneficial for those who has the problem of Formulas not calculating in Excel spreadsheet.

[Second link](https://www.pryor.com/blog/why-is-your-excel-formula-not-calculating/)

I discovered three ways to solve this problem in this website such as Check for automatic recalculation and check for circular references.

I think this site is ok but not advantageous.
