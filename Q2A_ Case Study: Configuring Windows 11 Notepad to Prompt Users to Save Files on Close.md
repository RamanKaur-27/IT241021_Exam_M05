Case Study: Configuring Windows 11 Notepad to Prompt Users to Save Files on Close

Background Information:

Issue Reported: Users are not being prompted to save files when closing Notepad in Windows 11 if there are unsaved changes.

There are two sites which I find to solve this problem.

[First site](https://www.easeus.com/file-recovery/recover-unsaved-deleted-lost-notepad-text-document.html?srsltid=AfmBOoo2wpmvCANoORLqZlLJDFT0QiMf9hDp9SGri1PKTQeqDISAB4pn)

In this website, I discovered six ways to recover unsaved files.

To save files, you can use free file recovery software, there are a lot of steps under this process.

This site is not very useful.

[Second site](https://superuser.com/questions/1689266/warning-for-unsaved-files-in-notepadpp)

In this website, I read that when I have unsaved files in notepad and I close the file it does not warn me.

To enable this setting, I find some steps in this website.

Firstly, Go to settings-> preferences-> Backup

Disable remember current session for next launch.

Disable Enable session snapshot and periodic backup.

I find this site very advantageous.
