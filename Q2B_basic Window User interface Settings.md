###Find a  few sites with basic Window User interface   Settings.

[First Site](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2100277/where-to-find-user-interface-ui-design-patterns-for-windows-applications)

In this website, I discovered that there are sites like Pattern Tap and UI-Patterns, which have a great collection of design patterns used in User Interface.

I think that this site is not very useful for user interface settings.


[Second Link](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=xcloud.customize_ui_settings.htm&type=5)

I discovered various user interface settings in this website.

First of all, I find Enable collapsible sections, Enable hover details, Enable related list hover links and show quick create.

I also find a lot of other settings such as Enable inline editing, Enable enhanced lists, Enable tab bar organizer and Enable printable list views.

I noticed that it is a very beneficial site for basic user interface settings.
