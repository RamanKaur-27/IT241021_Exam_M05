### Find a few sites with troubleshooting  a list of very common Excel mistakes.

[First site](https://medium.com/@Emma_Donery/most-common-excel-errors-and-how-to-fix-them-5cf4e124b35e)

I find this site very interesting because I noticed various common excel mistakes and ways to solve them

The common excel mistake is ######Error, and I can fix it with resize the cell

The other basic excel mistake is #NAME? and I can solve it by various ways which I read in this site.

[Second site](https://www.f9finance.com/common-errors-in-excel/)

I think that this website is not very useful because only errors are mentioned in this site but not valuable solutions to fix that problems.

### Describe the most common mistake people make in excel 

One of the most common mistakes people make in excel is incorrect use of cell references - particularly mixing up relative and absolute references.
